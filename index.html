    <h2>Understanding JavaScript as a Practical Object</h2>
    <h3>Objects</h3>
    <p>
      Javascript essentially behaves with an object the same way we humans
      interact with an object. So moving ahead I will be taking example of a
      Backpack to understand the different concepts.
    </p>
    <h4>Object Container</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Backpack is an object. This object has different properties which
        includes color, volume, name, etc. This object also has different
        features like opening and closing. Backpack object can also contain
        another object inside it, which can have properties of its own.
      </li>
      <li>
        The backpack obviously requires a place, maybe a box. So, we use
        variable, such as <code><mark>const backpack = {</mark></code
        >. The variable that we are using here is <strong>Constant</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The name backpack is very generic, it does not define the exact type of
        the object. So, the backpack needs a name and every object needs a
        name.<img
